Learning Moments

Learning moments is a social platform for students learning how to code! 
Users are able to create, update, and delete posts, as well as read others posts.

I decided to add myown flare to the NSS project by making it relevant to learning how to code, as well as add small touches like additional styling, user photos, small touches like that!

This project was one of the first time I built a front-end application using React from scratch!

I learned so much from this project, primarily managing state using react hooks.

This project has a separate repository for the database.json file where data is contained. 
All data is obtained via fetch calls to database.json file.
